* Purpose

This package should be a swiss knife for building automated trading
bots in Common Lisp. At present, it is draws all of its information
from publically accessilble sources, namely the still extant but
existentially tenuous yahoo finance, the free (but requiring
registration) API offered by finnhub.io, and most recently, the alpaca
trading API. Alpaca doesn't really offer service to people outside the
United States, which is a pain in the ass, because their service is
well documented, and their APIs are solid. Ultimately, I'm probably
going to use this collection with Interactive Brokers, which operate
all over the world, but specifically in Canada where I am located.

I will be adding support for various API's as I move along scratching
my own itches. I'd like to get the yahoo finance support to parity
with the yfinance python module built to their API.
